
For a regular PlatformIO project, this directory is intended for project
specific (private) libraries (and normally called 'lib').

However for this ESPHome integration of the daalderop component, it is
named 'components' so that the ESPHome External Components mechanism can find
the mbus_controller component inside of it.

Code that is unit tested also resides here of course (it is part of the
component), and is found automatically by the PlatformIO Library Dependency
Finder.
